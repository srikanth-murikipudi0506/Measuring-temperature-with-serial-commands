# Measuring-temperature-with-serial-commands
Measure the temperature with pt100 on conditional basis using serial commands

In this project, Arduino Mega is used and interface max31865 ADC, DS3231 RTC module and a I2C oled display.

Follow the steps to measure the temperature.
Step 1: upload programa and open Serial Monitor
step 2: Type 1 in text box of Serial Monitor and hit enter key. The Arduino will start measuring the temperature and generates a report on Serial Monitor.
step 3: Type 0 in text box of Serial Monitor and hit enter key. The Arduino will stop measuring the temperature.
